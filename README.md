# Olsztyńskie Autobusy
## About
### Project
Olsztyńskie Autobusy is an umbrella project for engineered designs centered around public transport extensions and analytics in Olsztyn (and maybe Warsaw in the future).
### Motivation
Learning how to build redundant, data-driven infrastructure with full support for telemetrics & monitoring.
### Current state
Currently, we're working on a minimal product for the first project (or first milestone), which is historical data aggregation and lookup of real-time positions of the logged vehicles, presented on a responsive map, in the city of Olsztyn. This project's called "MVP: Olsztyn". You can see the progress for the project on its board in the _Projects_ section of this repo.
### Name
As the project's name is a bit too clannish, there were suggestions to rename it. Here are a few:
- Smart Buses
- Smartobus
## Documentation (MVP: Olsztyn)
### Architecture
TODO(amw): write about it.
### About
TODO(amw): write about it.
### Docs in the code
As it's nearly impossible to maintain agility and write up-to-date docs for the future contributors/maintainers, source holds documentation for every package, function, ... etc. where needed. As the source is mostly Go code, docs can be generated from the source using godoc.
### How to put it on
TODO(amw): write about it.
### CI status
